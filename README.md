# dbms_project


We decided to go with the MySQL database as none of our team members knew mongo db. We also have been learning MySQL in college and decided the best way to go was with whatever knowledge we had.
I made 5 database tables as per our websites requirement. Login,Register,Acc info, Table cards and table transactions. Initially I made the databases very basic. Only added the basic columns and some inputs into the databases.
As the project progressed I realised I didnt need so many databases and I could reduce it to a lot lesser. Discussing it along with my teammates I realised that I only needed to have 3 databases which were cards, transactions and users. The users database could hold the Login and Register db for what I initially thought. Cards db held the acc info.
I added a few more special characteristics like the current time stamp
