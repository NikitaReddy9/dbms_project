We first started with the register page. Connected the database and used POST to get information from the user on the website and committed to database. Throws an error if username is taken.
Sends the user to login page. In the login page we added the inputs for the users to login. We had a tough time connecting it to the validate page to validate if the email and password
were matching. Shows incorrect details if email and password dont match. Member signup option is also available on the login page. Next we made the validate page. It was basic MySQL queries
to check if the given username and password match. Then the signup page which was pretty straightforward did the styling added the inputs for the needed registering. Logout was the most simple,
it just destroyed the session and sent the user to the login page. Next the homepage, we added a side menu and gave a basic layout on how we wanted our page to look like. The account page took
the longest to do. It wasnt easy to get all the information and display it properly. It kept throwing so many errors that we had to solve step by step.
